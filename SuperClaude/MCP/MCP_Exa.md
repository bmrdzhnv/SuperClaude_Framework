# Exa MCP Server

**Purpose**: Neural semantic search engine for finding relevant, high-quality web content

## Triggers
- Research requests requiring semantic understanding vs keyword matching
- Domain-specific content discovery needs (technical, academic, business)
- High-quality source validation and authority-based filtering
- Real-time web research with relevance scoring
- Research automation requiring intelligent source discovery

## Choose When
- **Over WebSearch**: When you need semantically relevant, high-quality sources
- **For research depth**: When content quality and authority matter more than speed
- **For domain expertise**: Technical documentation, research papers, industry analysis
- **For semantic queries**: "Find content similar to X" vs "Search for keywords Y"
- **Not for simple lookup**: Basic factual queries, dictionary definitions

## Works Best With
- **crawl4ai**: Exa discovers sources → crawl4ai extracts and processes content
- **Sequential**: Exa provides research strategy → Sequential coordinates multi-source analysis
- **Serena**: Exa research results → Serena stores for cross-session knowledge building

## Examples
```
"find React accessibility best practices" → Exa (semantic discovery of quality sources)
"research DeFi yield farming protocols" → Exa (domain-specific crypto content)
"discover AI safety research papers" → Exa (academic and technical content)
"analyze competitive landscape for SaaS tools" → Exa (business intelligence)
"what is 2+2?" → WebSearch (simple factual query)
"current weather in NYC" → WebSearch (real-time data lookup)
