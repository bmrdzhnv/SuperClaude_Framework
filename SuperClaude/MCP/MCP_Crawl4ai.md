# Crawl4ai MCP Server

**Purpose**: Advanced web content extraction and markdown conversion with structured data processing

## Triggers
- Web content extraction and processing into clean markdown format
- Multi-page crawling with configurable depth and scope
- Content research requiring structured data extraction
- Documentation generation from web sources
- Bulk web content processing for knowledge base creation

## Choose When
- **Over basic web scraping**: When you need clean, structured content extraction
- **For content processing**: Converting web content to usable markdown format
- **For research workflows**: Building knowledge bases from web sources
- **For documentation**: Creating structured docs from multiple web pages
- **Not for simple page reading**: Single-page content that doesn't need processing

## Works Best With
- **Exa**: Exa discovers quality sources → crawl4ai extracts and converts content
- **Sequential**: Sequential plans extraction strategy → crawl4ai processes systematically
- **Serena**: crawl4ai extracts content → Serena stores processed knowledge

## Examples
```
"extract content from these 10 documentation pages" → crawl4ai (bulk content processing)
"convert this technical blog series to markdown" → crawl4ai (structured extraction)
"crawl React docs and create searchable knowledge base" → crawl4ai (documentation processing)
"process competitor analysis from multiple sources" → crawl4ai (business intelligence)
"just read this single page for me" → Read tool (simple page reading)
"get current stock price" → WebSearch (real-time data, not content extraction)
```
