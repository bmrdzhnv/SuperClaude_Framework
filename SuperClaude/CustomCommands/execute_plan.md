# Execute SuperClaude Plan

Execute a plan generated by `/sc:plan` command with validation and progress tracking.

## Usage

Execute latest plan:
```
/execute-plan
```

Execute specific plan:
```
/execute-plan @~/.claude/plans/plan_name.json
```

Execute with options:
```
/execute-plan --dry-run    # Simulate execution
/execute-plan --step       # Step-by-step with confirmation
/execute-plan --from 3     # Start from step 3
/execute-plan --rollback   # Undo last execution
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Plan**: Read JSON plan from ~/.claude/plans/
2. **Validate**: Check all commands and dependencies
3. **Execute**: Run commands in sequence
4. **Track**: Update progress via TodoWrite
5. **Report**: Generate execution summary

## Plan Executor

The actual execution is handled by a Python script:

!python ~/.claude/scripts/plan_executor.py {{args}}

## Features

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Step completion markers
- Time tracking per step
- Error reporting

### Safety Features
- Pre-execution validation
- Dependency checking
- Rollback capability
- State preservation

### Execution Modes
- **Auto**: Run all steps automatically
- **Step**: Confirm each step
- **Dry Run**: Simulate without execution
- **Resume**: Continue from failure point

## Example Execution

```
/execute-plan @~/.claude/plans/auth_system.json

üìã Loading plan: auth_system.json
‚úÖ Validation passed: 6 steps ready

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Executing Step 1/6: Research auth patterns
   Command: /sc:research "React auth NextAuth JWT"
   Agents: [security-engineer]
   ‚úÖ Complete (15s)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Executing Step 2/6: Design auth architecture
   Command: /sc:design auth-middleware
   Agents: [backend-architect, security-engineer]
   ‚úÖ Complete (32s)

[... continues ...]

üìä Execution Summary:
   Total Steps: 6
   Completed: 6
   Failed: 0
   Time: 3m 42s

‚úÖ Plan executed successfully!
```

## Error Handling

If a step fails:
1. Execution pauses
2. Error details displayed
3. Options presented:
   - Retry the step
   - Skip and continue
   - Rollback all changes
   - Abort execution

## Integration with /sc:plan

Plans generated by `/sc:plan` are automatically compatible:

```bash
# Generate plan
/sc:plan "build React auth" --save auth_plan

# Execute plan
/execute-plan @~/.claude/plans/auth_plan.json
```

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Execution
```bash
# Execute only if tests pass
/execute-plan --condition "npm test"
```

### Parallel Steps
```bash
# Execute parallel steps concurrently
/execute-plan --parallel
```

### Custom Variables
```bash
# Pass variables to plan
/execute-plan --var API_KEY=xxx --var ENV=prod
```

## Monitoring

Track execution in real-time:
- TodoWrite updates for each step
- Progress bar in terminal
- Logs saved to ~/.claude/logs/
- Metrics collected for optimization
