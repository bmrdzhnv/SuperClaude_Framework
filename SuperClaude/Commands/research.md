# /sc:research - AI-Enhanced Documentation and Deep Research Service

**Unified research command supporting both lightweight documentation gathering and comprehensive deep research workflows.**

## Dual-Mode Operation

### ðŸ”¬ Documentation Mode (Default)
Gather current documentation, APIs, and patterns for agent expertise with Exa/Crawl4ai.

### ðŸ§  Deep Research Mode (--deep-research)
Comprehensive research with adaptive planning, multi-hop reasoning, and evidence synthesis using Tavily.

## Usage
```bash
# Documentation mode (agent support)
/sc:research "topic" [--specialty auto|code|crypto|algorithmic|business|security] [--depth shallow|normal|deep] [--ai-analysis] [--token-efficient] [--multi-source]

# Deep research mode (comprehensive analysis)
/sc:research "query" --deep-research [--depth quick|standard|deep|exhaustive] [--strategy planning|intent|unified]
```

## ðŸ”¬ Documentation Mode (Default)

### Purpose: Enable Agents with Current Knowledge

Agents have **timeless expertise** (how to architect, secure, teach) but lack **current content** (latest APIs, frameworks, patterns). Research bridges this gap.

### How It Works

#### Phase 1: Parallel Discovery
**Simultaneous Search for Maximum Coverage**
- **Exa**: High-quality technical documentation with semantic understanding
- **Google** (via crawl4ai): Real-time comprehensive results
- **Execution**: Both run in parallel for 40-60% speed improvement

#### Phase 2: Intelligent Extraction
**Content-Aware Tool Routing**
- **Single page**: `crawl_url` (simple) or `intelligent_extract` (complex)
- **Documentation sites**: `deep_crawl_site` with depth control
- **Multiple URLs**: `batch_crawl` for parallel processing
- **Mixed media**: `process_file` (PDFs), `extract_youtube_transcript` (videos)
- **Token optimization**: Auto-summarization for large content

#### Phase 3: Structure for Agents
**Organize for Agent Consumption**
- Extract key sections: Installation, Configuration, Usage, API Reference
- Maintain source attribution for credibility
- Create topic indexes for quick agent lookup
- Tag with timestamps and relevance scores

#### Phase 4: Store and Serve
**Persistent Documentation Layer**
- **Serena**: Session persistence for agent access
- **Structure**: Agent-consumable format with quick lookups
- **Updates**: Refresh when agents detect outdated content

### Usage Patterns

#### Research-First Development
```bash
# Research current patterns, then implement
/sc:research "Next.js 14 app router patterns"
# â†’ Stores structured docs in Serena
/sc:implement landing-page
# â†’ Frontend-architect uses researched patterns
```

#### Continuous Documentation Updates
```bash
# Keep agents current with latest docs
/sc:research "React 19 features" --depth deep
# Later in session, agents reference stored React 19 docs
```

#### Multi-Source Comparison
```bash
# Research alternatives for informed decisions
/sc:research "auth providers comparison: Auth0 vs Clerk vs NextAuth"
# Security-engineer analyzes all options
# Requirements-analyst evaluates trade-offs
```

### Optimization Flags

#### --token-efficient
Maximizes efficiency through intelligent extraction
- Uses `intelligent_extract` for 88.5% token reduction
- Applies `auto_summarize` for large content
- Preserves key information while reducing volume

#### --depth [shallow|normal|deep]
Controls research thoroughness
- **shallow**: Quick overview, main documentation only
- **normal**: Standard depth, includes examples and patterns
- **deep**: Comprehensive, includes issues, discussions, edge cases

#### --store
Explicitly store for agent access (default behavior)
- Saves to Serena memory for session persistence
- Creates structured indexes for agent lookups
- Maintains source links and timestamps

```

### Agent-Research Integration

#### How Agents Use Research

**Frontend-architect**
```yaml
needs: "Current framework patterns, component libraries, performance techniques"
uses_research_for: "Architectural decisions based on latest best practices"
example: "Researched Next.js patterns â†’ Applies to routing architecture"
```

**Security-engineer**
```yaml
needs: "Security vulnerabilities, OWASP guidelines, auth patterns"
uses_research_for: "Security analysis with current threat landscape"
example: "Researched JWT vulnerabilities â†’ Audits authentication system"
```

**Backend-architect**
```yaml
needs: "API patterns, database strategies, scaling techniques"
uses_research_for: "System design with current technologies"
example: "Researched microservices patterns â†’ Designs service architecture"
```

**Learning-guide**
```yaml
needs: "Tutorial content, documentation, learning resources"
uses_research_for: "Creating learning paths with current materials"
example: "Researched React tutorials â†’ Structures learning progression"
```

### Storage Structure

```yaml
serena_memory:
  research:
    topics:              # Organized by subject
      react_19:         # Version-specific docs
      nextauth_v5:      # Framework documentation

    sessions:           # Temporal organization
      2024_01_20:       # Today's research

    agent_access:       # Quick lookups
      frontend:         # Frontend-relevant docs

## ðŸ§  Deep Research Mode (--deep-research)

*Activated when using `--deep-research` flag - enables comprehensive research capabilities with adaptive planning, multi-hop reasoning, and evidence-based synthesis.*

### Context Framework Note
This mode activates comprehensive research capabilities with the deep-research-agent, using Tavily for primary search and Sequential for complex reasoning.

### Triggers for Deep Research Mode
